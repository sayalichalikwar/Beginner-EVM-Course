#  Beginner-EVM-Course
This course was designed about some basic concepts about Web3 and Blockchain with the solidity programming. 
After Completing all three given modules I have to make a contract with the help of this concepts.

## Project
I have a Project to create contract. In that I created a contract name as MyToken where token name as "stable" and token abbreviation as "constant" along with its total supply set to be zero. If I want to mint some amount of stable tokens then it will be added to the total supply of it. Also if I burns those tokens, it will get subtracted from the total supply (Only if there is enough balance).

### Operation 

* I used Online Remix IDE compiler for writing the solidity code Program with a version.
* I created a file which is in the repository named as Second.sol .

### Installing

* If you are using Remix IDE then you simply compile the code.
* After compiling the code , you have to deploy the Contract.
* And after deploying the code , you have to enter certain inputs.
